Recent polling indicates Donald Trump has a commanding lead over Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, his nearest challenger.
The reason the Radical, highly Conflicted Judge Juan Merchan had to come up with three FAKE options for the jury to choose from, without requiring them to be unanimous, which is completely UNAMERICAN AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL, is because the Corrupt, Soros backed D.A., Alvin Bragg, couldn‚Äôt come close to proving that any crime was committed. THERE WAS NO CRIME. Legal Expense paid to a lawyer was marked, by a bookkeeper using a dropdown menu in a computer program, as Legal Expense paid to a lawyer. WHAT ELSE COULD YOU CALL IT? There is NO CASE, just a Democrat Persecutor controlled by Crooked Joe Biden‚Äôs White House, a Democrat Judge, and a biased venue. This is nothing but an Election Interfering Witch Hunt, and the American People know it! MAGA2024

Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn‚Äôt be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and ‚ÄúTRUMP,‚Äù will never be able to settle. The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe, and Europe‚Äôs money is guaranteed, while the United States will get nothing back. Why didn‚Äôt Sleepy Joe Biden demand Equalization, in that this War is far more important to Europe than it is to us ‚Äî We have a big, beautiful Ocean as separation. On top of this, Zelenskyy admits that half of the money we sent him is ‚ÄúMISSING.‚Äù He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden ‚Äúlike a fiddle.‚Äù A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only ‚ÄúTRUMP,‚Äù and the Trump Administration, can do. Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring Peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the ‚Äúgravy train‚Äù going. I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died ‚Äì And so it continues‚Ä¶..

That‚Äôs why I keep [saying] there should be a directed verdict, meaning the Judge should take it out of the jury‚Äôs hands, and say, ‚ÄòProsecution, you did not meet your burden, you did not find that there is a crime here. Donald Trump, go home, go campaign.‚Äô‚Äù

Stern School of Business, Eli Bartov, loudly declared from the witness stand‚Ä¶‚ÄôPeople that don‚Äôt know accounting can think this is all fraud,‚Äô Mr. Bartov explained. ‚ÄòMy main finding is that there is no evidence whatsoever of any accounting fraud.‚Äô He said he thoroughly reviewed the Trump Organization‚Äôs statements of financial condition, and his analysis showed that they ‚Äòwere not materially misstated.‚Äô ‚ÄòSo your expert opinion is, from an accounting perspective, the attorney general‚Äôs complaint had no merit?‚Äô Judge Engoron asked. ‚ÄòAbsolutely, my opinion, absolutely,‚Äô Mr. Bartov reinforced. ‚ÄòThere is not a single reference to a violation of any accounting provision.‚Äô

President @realDonaldTrump lifted Ron DeSantis, an unknown and unaccomplished Congressman, out of obscurity; catapulted him to the Florida Republican gubernatorial nomination, and had to drag him over the finish line in the skin-tight 2018 election.Therefore, the DeSantis candidacy for President is the TREACHEROUS ACT of a backstabbing weasel and ingrate.Read More:newsweek.com/roger-stone-ron-d
Judge Engoron has refused to obey the decision of the Appellate Division relative to the Statute of Limitations. This is a confrontation between a Judge and those that rule above him - A very bad situation in which to place New York State and the Rule of Law! Engoron has disrespected the Appellate Division and its very clear and precise ruling. He should be made to do so, and at the same time, release the GAG ORDER. This is the 5th time in this case that he has been overturned, a record. His credibility, and that of Letitia James, has been shattered. We will abide by the decision of the Appellate Division, and post either a bond, equivalent securities, or cash. This also shows how ridiculous and outrageous Engoron‚Äôs original decision was at $450 Million. I DID NOTHING WRONG, AND NEW YORK SHOULD NEVER BE PUT IN A POSITION LIKE THIS AGAIN. BUSINESSES ARE FLEEING, VIOLENT CRIME IS FLOURISHING, AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS BE RESOLVED IN ITS TOTALITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU!

People are just starting to give me credit for having a GREAT DEBATE. The Voters and Voter Polls showed it, but the Fake News Media wasn‚Äôt giving the credit that was due. Now they are seeing the results with independent Voters, Evangelicals, and more - and saying, WOW! Remember, I wasn‚Äôt debating one person, I was debating three. They should fire everybody at ABC Fake News, whose two lightweight ‚Äúanchors‚Äù have brought disgrace onto the company!

The 14th Amendment Right of American Citizenship never had anything to do with modern day "gate crashers," illegal immigrants who break the Law by being in our Country, it had everything to do with giving Citizenship to former slaves. Our Founding Fathers are "spinning in their graves" at the idea that our Country can be taken away from us. No Nation in the World has anything like this.

Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation. He has done everything possible to destroy our Country, from our Southern Border, to Energy Dominance, National Security, International Standing, and so much more. He was annihilated in an Earth Shattering Debate, and now the Corrupt and Radical Democrats are throwing him overboard. He was not fit to serve from the  very beginning, but the people around him lied to America about his Complete and Total Mental, Physical, and Cognitive Demise.

Most importantly, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the Rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured. It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country. Nothing is known at this time about the shooter, who is now dead. I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!

For purposes of this United States Policy, we will consider Countries that use the VAT System, which is far more punitive than a Tariff, to be similar to that of a Tariff. Sending merchandise, product, or anything by any other name through another Country, for purposes of unfairly harming America, will not be accepted. In addition, we will make provision for subsidies provided by Countries in order to take Economic advantage of the United States. Likewise, provisions will be made for Nonmonetary Tariffs and Trade Barriers that some Countries charge in order to keep our product out of their domain or, if they do not even let U.S. businesses operate. We are able to accurately determine the cost of these Nonmonetary Trade Barriers. It is fair to all, no other Country can complain and, in some cases, if a Country feels that the United States would be getting too high a Tariff, all they have to do is reduce or terminate their Tariff against us. There are no Tariffs if you manufacture or build your product in the United States.

Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Announces ‚ÄúFair and Reciprocal Plan‚Äù on Trade
One of the most vicious effects of the Biden Inflation Tax is how Crooked Joe has made it impossible for millions of Americans, especially YOUNG Americans, to buy a home, a car, or even make rent. High inflation means high prices, high interest rates, high mortgage rates, and death for the American Dream. Under Biden, the 30-year mortgage rate is almost 8%--by contrast, the month I left office, it was 2.6%. That means a typical Minnesota home mortgage that used to cost you $2,000 dollars a month now costs nearly $3,100 dollars a month. And because of the Biden Price Hikes, it is harder than ever to save for a downpayment!

Kamala Harris and the Department of Justice have once again launched an unconstitutional and illegal attack on America‚Äôs Democracy.

Governor Glenn Youngkin, who is doing an incredible job, was correct in removing non-citizens from the voter rolls, a Law that was actually passed by then Democrat Governor Tim Kaine. Now Kamala, because we are doing so well in Virginia, wants to put those non-citizens back on the voter rolls, even though they aren‚Äôt allowed to vote. The only reason for this is CHEATING. This is unAmerican and, with less than 30 days until the Election, it‚Äôs clear-cut ELECTION INTERFERENCE.

This is a lawsuit that should never have been brought. It is a POLITICALLY MOTIVATED WITCH HUNT by a Racist Attorney General, and a Deranged, Trump Hating Judge. It is ELECTION INTERFERENCE at a level never seen before. No wonder people and companies are fleeing New York!
Many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State. The United States can no longer suffer the massive Trade Deficits and Subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned. If Canada merged with the U.S., there would be no Tariffs, taxes would go way down, and they would be TOTALLY SECURE from the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them. Together, what a great Nation it would be!!!

Writer Maggot Hagerman of the Failing New York Times wrote almost her entire FAKE story today about the Trump Hating Judge‚Äôs Gag Order (They love to silence me!), rather than the Racist Attorney General‚Äôs STAR witness chocking like a dog on the Witness Stand (Perry Mason?), and admitting that I NEVER asked him to do anything wrong. He also admitted that he lied to Congress Under Oath, AGAIN, brand new charges. THAT MEANS THEY NO LONGER HAVE A WITNESS, OR A CASE. She also failed to report that the Trump Hating Judge refuses to respect or accept the Appeals Court decision reversing him, a first!

TUNE IN: Exclusive Hannity Interview with President Trump and Elon Musk Tonight at 9 PM ET
Elise Stefanik: ‚ÄúIn NY, President Trump is facing a two-pronged attack. Soros-funded Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg issued the original indictment in a case so absurd that even the Washington Post‚Äôs liberal editorial board called it a ‚Äòshaky‚Äô case. At the same time, New York‚Äôs Democrat AG Letitia James teamed up with Democrat Judge Arthur Engoron to try to put the Trump Organization out of business. Recall that James campaigned on targeting Trump. She said that going after him was her primary motivation to run for office and that she‚Äôs got her ‚Äòeyes on Trump Tower.‚Äô Attorney General James‚Äô case doesn‚Äôt even have a victim. President Trump repaid the loans to the banks in full and on time. The ‚Äòcrime‚Äô in question is that President Trump is leading Joe Biden in the polls...This unprecedented lawfare against President Trump cannot continue. The American people are the guardians of democracy, which is why, in 2024, the American people must and will elect President Trump back to the White House.‚Äù

CEASE & DESIST: I, together with many Attorneys and Legal Scholars, am watching the Sanctity of the 2024 Presidential Election very closely because I know, better than most, the rampant Cheating and Skullduggery that has taken place by the Democrats in the 2020 Presidential Election. It was a Disgrace to our Nation! Therefore, the 2024 Election, where Votes have just started being cast, will be under the closest professional scrutiny and, WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again. We cannot let our Country further devolve into a Third World Nation, AND WE WON‚ÄôT! Please beware that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials. Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.
Instead of American workers worrying about losing their jobs to foreign nations‚ÄîI want foreign nations to be worried about losing their jobs to America!

Andrew C. McCarthy: ‚ÄúReading between the lines of all available evidence, you can find an organized effort by the bureau to put its thumb on the scale for Biden‚Äôs campaign. I can appreciate clever. It‚Äôs when people‚Äîespecially government officials‚Äîinsult my intelligence that I get angry. And we should all be angry over the United States government‚Äôs interference in the 2020 presidential election, hot on the heels of its self-abasement during and in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election. The FBI, as the pointy end of the executive-branch spear, would have us believe that it in no way intentionally interfered in the 2020 election. Yet the evidence that it did so, and that its doing so was part of a yearslong pattern, is by leaps & bounds stronger than the evidence that the Trump campaign corruptly conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election‚Äîthe baseless allegation, energetically promoted by the bureau, that inflamed the country for two years.‚Äù

Hans von Spakovsky, The Daily Signal: ‚ÄúFirst, Section 3 of the 14 Amendment applies only to individuals who were previously a ‚Äòmember of Congress,‚Äô an ‚Äòofficer of the United States,‚Äô or a state official. Individuals who are elected‚Äîsuch as the president and vice president‚Äîare not officers within the meaning of Section 3. Second, no federal court has convicted Trump of engaging in ‚Äòinsurrection or rebellion.‚Äô In fact, the Senate acquitted Trump of that charge in his second impeachment. Third, some scholars assert Section 3 doesn‚Äôt even exist anymore as a constitutional matter after the Amnesty Acts of 1872 and 1898‚Äîa matter completely ignored by the court today. Fourth, prior court rulings have held that Section 3 is not self-executing and Congress has never passed any federal law providing for enforcement, meaning that courts such as the Colorado Supreme Court have no legal authority to enforce Section 3.‚Äù

Almost all experts and legal analysts have stated, for all to see, that the Litigation before Judge Engoron is a sham and disgrace, a dark time in New York Judicial history. I did nothing wrong but, most importantly, as legal experts state very strongly, I already won a vast majority of the case in the Appellate Division with their decision issued in June, a decision that Judge Engoron refuses to acknowledge or accept. He incorrectly, and perhaps fraudulently, valued Mar-a-Lago at $18,000,000, but his disrespect of the Appellate Division, and their opinion, is far worse. A.G. Letitia James is a Racist Scoundrel who thinks she has total power and control over the Judge. She gave him the fraudulent numbers from which he made his ridiculous Mar-a-Lago calculations. A horrible and illegal Witch Hunt, but somehow it will all be corrected and fair. God Bless America!

45th President Donald J. Trump is again the Republican Nominee for President of the United States, and is currently dominating in the Polls. However, he is being inundated by the Media with questions because of this Rigged Biden Trial, which President Trump is not allowed to comment on, or answer, because of Judge Juan Merchan‚Äôs UNPRECEDENTED AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL Gag Order. His Opponents have unlimited rights to question, but he has no right to respond. There has never been a situation like this in our Country‚Äôs History, a Candidate that is not allowed to answer questions. Even Crooked Joe Biden is talking about the Sham Case, and others inspired by his Administration. We request that Judge Merchan immediately LIFT THE GAG ORDER, so that President Trump is able to freely state his views, feelings, and policies. He is asking for his Constitutional Right to Free Speech. If it is not granted, this again becomes a Rigged Election!

I have had very unfair judges since entering politics, but nobody has been as unhinged as this guy. Mar-a-Lago is worth, perhaps, 100 times more than he values it. Other properties are likewise worth substantially more. I am worth billions more than my very conservatively stated financial statements, and therefore could not have defrauded the banks, who all made money & were all paid back, or are current, with no defaults or any other problem. Additionally, there is a powerful Disclaimer Clause on the first pages of the Financial Statements. It states that nothing in the Financial Statements should be accepted as fact!

I am in the process, along with my team, of interviewing various law firms to represent me in an Appeal of one of the most ridiculous and unfair Witch Hunts our Country has ever seen - The defamation Sham presided over by a Clinton appointed, highly partisan, Trump Hating Judge, Lewis Kaplan, who was, together with certain other Radical Left Democrat Judges, one of the most partisan and out of control activists that I have ever appeared before. He was a ‚Äúbully‚Äù who demanded two trials, rather than one, denied me Due Process, would not allow me to put forth vital evidence (of which there was much!), and only allowed me to be on the witness stand for minutes, telling my lawyer what to ask, and telling me to only give one word answers, as his wife and friends sat in cordoned off front row seats watching with glee. This entire HOAX is a disgrace to our American System of Justice. Any lawyer who takes a TRUMP CASE is either ‚ÄúCRAZY,‚Äù or a TRUE AMERICAN PATRIOT. I will make my decision soon!

In the Fake Biden Inspired Fraud Case against me, brought by the CORRUPT A.G., Letitia ‚ÄúPeekaboo‚Äù James of New York State, a sadly Crime Infested Place, where people and businesses are fleeing to other States in record numbers, it is her and the highly partisan Judge, who has been overturned many times, who defrauded me and the public by valuing my assets at a fraction of what they are worth in order to try and convict me, without a trial or jury, of FRAUD. She got him to Value Mar-a-Lago at $18,000,000, when it is worth 50 to 100 times that amount. My assets are worth MUCH MORE than listed on the 100% DISCLAIMED Financial Statements, and there are NO VICTIMS, EXCEPT ME. We WON on Statute of Limitations, and other things, at the Appeals Court, AND THIS RADICAL LEFT, TRUMP HATING JUDGE, REFUSES TO ACCEPT THEIR DECISION. THIS CASE SHOULD BE DROPPED, IMMEDIATELY. IT‚ÄôS AMAZING! HE IS OUT OF CONTROL, AND TOTALLY AFRAID OF PEEKABOO. A COMPLETE MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE & ELECTION INTERFERENCE!

Andy McCarthy: "Let‚Äôs stick with the relevant, undisputed facts of the case. Merchan should dismiss the case because it is already apparent that Bragg cannot prove criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt. After three weeks of the prosecution‚Äôs case, I now believe the evidence would be insufficient even if Bragg had charged only New York‚Äôs misdemeanor business-records-falsification offense. As for the felony offense, as to which prosecutors must prove willfulness beyond a reasonable doubt (a heightened standard of scienter, i.e., criminal intent), Bragg‚Äôs evidence is woefully inadequate."

The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated IF that‚Äôs what the mother and the family desired. AND THEN A DISCUSSION WOULD ENSUE between the physicians and the mother.‚Äù In other words, the Baby would be executed after birth! ALWAYS REMEMBER - THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE RADICALS ON ABORTION.

Except that everyone with any common sense can see what I consider their real motives, how they were combing the rule book for stuff to use against Trump.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe vast mass of American voters could see what I believe was really happening: that the liberal elites were just appalled at Trump's continuing popularity and his ability to connect with voters ‚Äì and they were using anything they could find to derail his campaign.

He congratulated me on a very successful Republican National Convention and becoming the Republican nominee for President of the United States. He condemned the heinous assassination attempt last Saturday and remarked about the American people coming together in the spirit of Unity during these times. I appreciate President Zelenskyy for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families. Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity.
Nikki Haley, who said I was a great President and that she would ‚Äúnever run against me,‚Äù just stated that I ‚Äúshould not be kicked off the ballot‚Äù and that she ‚Äúwill beat me fair and square.‚Äù Her only problem is, a new Morning Consult poll that just came out has me leading her by 43 points in Iowa. Also, interestingly, I‚Äôve gone up 8 points, and she‚Äôs only gone up 4, but Ron DeSanctimonious has gone down by 4‚ÄìCould be the end of the line for Ron. I would like to congratulate ‚ÄúAida‚Äù Hutchinson on the fact that, after being at ZERO for 7 consecutive months, he has broken the ice and is now at a solid 1%. Sloppy Chris Christie is ‚ÄúDEAD!‚Äù

BIDEN IS NOT TOO OLD, HE‚ÄôS TOO INCOMPETENT!
Even though I did nothing wrong, a Radical Left New York Judge, a true Trump Hater, Arthur Engoron (Are we allowed to speak about his Unconstitutional Gag Order?), picked a number out of THIN AIR, $355,000,000, plus interest (reminiscent of John Lovitz, ‚ÄúThe Liar,‚Äù on SNL when it was good), & wants me to bond it, which is not possible for bonding companies to do in such a high amount, before I can even Appeal. That is CRAZY! If I sold assets, and then won the Appeal, the assets would be forever gone. Also, putting up money before an Appeal is VERY EXPENSIVE. When I win the Appeal, all of that money is gone, and I would have done nothing wrong. The Crooked Judge, who has already been overturned 4 times on this case (a record!), fully understands this. He gave us a demand which he knows is impossible to do. This Witch Hunt, between a bad Judge and a Corrupt & Racist Attorney General, is horrible for New York. Businesses are FLEEING, while Violent Crime flourishes. ELECTION INTERFERENCE!

It‚Äôs the popular currency among Biden Democrats. Abiding by the rule of law is a mere inconvenience, a pesky nuisance. It can be discarded like yesterday‚Äôs trash‚Ä¶That is exactly what Bragg has done. His case against the accused is beyond anemic. It is an audacious corruption of the legal process.

My great sister, Maryanne, passed away yesterday at the age of 86. A truly beautiful woman, tall and elegant, with a presence like no other, she was also a tremendous student, intellect, and Judge, in charge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, just below the U.S. Supreme Court. Her life was largely problem free, PERFECT, until I made it difficult for her when I decided to run for President. The Fake News, and others, went after her mercilessly, and because of the fact that she felt it inappropriate, due to her position, to defend herself, it just never stopped! While tough and strong, she was made to suffer in those years from 2016 until her Retirement. I will never forget the many times people would come up to me and say,‚ÄúYour sister was the smartest person on the Court.‚Äù I was always honored by that, but understood exactly what they meant‚ÄîThey were right! She was a great Judge, and a great sister. She will be truly missed!

We go weeks without hearing the name Joe Biden in the media, when we do it‚Äôs usually an announcement that he is giving more aid away to foreign entities or pardoning a murderer. He is still the sitting President although he probably spends most time in the horizontal position. Donald Trump on the other hand is moving mountains, changing the world, the media everyday is flooded with decisions and announcements Donald Trump is making. We would argue that Donald Trump was President from Nov 5th, in the eyes of the world, power has shifted already. It‚Äôs a new day and it‚Äôs a new world, sit back  and enjoy the ride.

‚Ä¶as stated by the relevant Institutions. Judge Engoron challenges the highly respected Expert Witness for receiving fees, which is standard and accepted practice for Expert Witnesses. The ignorant Judge did not even try to listen to the Expert Witness. This is a great insult to a man of impeccable character and qualifications. The Judge ignores the Law!

On Trade, I have decided, for purposes of Fairness, that I will charge a RECIPROCAL Tariff meaning, whatever Countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them - No more, no less!For purposes of this United States Policy, we will consider Countries that use the VAT System, which is far more punitive than a Tariff, to be similar to that of a Tariff. Sending merchandise, product, or anything by any other name through another Country, for purposes of unfairly harming America, will not be accepted. In addition, we will make provision for subsidies provided by Countries in order to take Economic advantage of the United States. Likewise, provisions will be made for Nonmonetary Tariffs and Trade Barriers that some Countries charge in order to keep our product out of their domain or, if they do not even let U.S. businesses operate. We are able to accurately determine the cost of these Nonmonetary Trade Barriers. It is fair to all, no other Country can complain and, in some cases, if a Country feels that the United States would be getting too high a Tariff, all they have to do is reduce or terminate their Tariff against us. There are no Tariffs if you manufacture or build your product in the United States.

Despite the fact that I was there, on time and on schedule, it was just learned that one of the jurors is, unfortunately, not feeling well, and for that reason, today‚Äôs session of the trial, having to do with a woman I know absolutely nothing about, has therefore been cancelled with a new date to be determined. Of course, all of these various ‚ÄúBiden Political Opponent‚Äù trials just happen to be starting, with great purpose, in the middle of what will be the most important Election in the History of our Country. They could have all began years ago, or years after, but, certainly not DURING the Election. In actuality, they should have never been brought at all, because I have done nothing wrong. It is what it is, and I will do what I have to do, all I ask for is fair Judges and Juries, and I will win every one of them.‚Ä¶
THANK YOU‚ÄîMAGA! 
Just 3 years ago we had the strongest and safest Border in U.S. History. Today we have a catastrophe waiting to happen. It is the WORST BORDER IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, an open wound in our once great Country. TERRORISTS ARE POURING IN, UNCHECKED, FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. There is now a 100% chance that there will be MAJOR TERROR ATTACKS IN THE USA. CLOSE THE BORDER!

Judge Engoron is a political hack who ruled against me before the trial even started. He is doing the dirty work for the Democrat Party. I was not even given the option of a jury, This Rigged Case should have never been brought, but since it was, it should have been in the Commercial  Division, but Engoron WOULD NOT LET GO OF IT. He fought us, sanctioned us for no reason, fined us big money, never gave us even a one day delay. This is his big chance, and he was not going to let it go. In the meantime, they ‚Äúlost‚Äù their Star Witness, and my Financial Statements are GREAT! There was no fraud, so they are working with the corrupt A.G. whose campaign was ‚ÄúI will get Trump,‚Äù to develop something, anything.

Today‚Äôs pathetic motion is not just Illegal, it is also another Unconstitutional attempt to take away my First Amendment Rights, and to prevent me from saying the TRUTH ‚Äî that all of these Hoaxes are nothing but a political persecution of me, the MAGA Movement, and the Republican Party by Crooked Joe and his Despicable Thugs. The Radical Left Communists, Marxists, and Fascists are petrified of me speaking the TRUTH because the American People don‚Äôt want them destroying our Country. Make America Great Again!

This was an angry, polarizing, and hate-filled Speech. He barely mentioned Immigration, or the Worst Border in the History of the World. He will never fix Immigration, nor does he want to. He wants our Country to be flooded with Migrants. Crime will raise to levels never seen before, and it is happening very quickly!
The problem with FoxNews is that every time they put on someone who is positive and touting all of the good things I have done for the Country, they always feel it necessary to follow up with a really negative voice, often people who are storytellers and willing to outright lie. The daytime anchors are no match for these lunatics, and they get away with absolute murder. The net result is NOTHINGNESS, so what‚Äôs the purpose in watching?

In 3 years, we have gone from peace to anarchy. Why? Simply put, because of one man, President Donald Trump, He kept us all safe.
The Great Brian Jack joined my Campaign in 2016, and has diligently worked by my side for the last 8 years, serving with distinction as my White House Political Director in helping to enact our America First agenda that delivered historic results for the American People.

Laura Loomer doesn‚Äôt work for the Campaign. She‚Äôs a private citizen and longtime supporter. I disagree with the statements she made but, like the many millions of people who support me, she is tired of watching the Radical Left Marxists and Fascists violently attack and smear me, even to the point of doing anything to stop their Political Opponent, ME! I am now in California, which Democrats like Comrade Kamala Harris and Governor Gavin Newscum have completely DESTROYED. I will turn it all around and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! -DJT

I am pleased to nominate Christopher Landau to serve as Deputy Secretary of State. Chris will work closely with our great Secretary of State Nominee, Marco Rubio, to promote our Nation‚Äôs security and prosperity through an America First Foreign Policy. Chris served as my Ambassador to Mexico, where he worked tirelessly with our team to reduce illegal migration to the lowest levels in History. He is also one of our Country‚Äôs great lawyers, and clerked for both Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas on the United States Supreme Court. He graduated from Harvard College, first in his Class, and Harvard Law School, and has argued nine cases in the U.S. Supreme Court.

A great new book on Crooked Joe Biden is just out. Entitled,  BREAKING BIDEN, and written by New York Times  Bestselling Author, Alex Marlow, it exposes the hidden forces and secret money machine behind Joe Biden, his family, and his administration. Alex knows it all, and gives it to you in this fantastic new book. Highly recommended. ON SALE NOW!!!
Because I Endorsed Big Jim Justice of West Virginia for the U.S. Senate, and he has taken a commanding lead, Democrat Joe Manchin has decided not to seek re-election. Looking good for Big Jim!
Kamala refuses to do interviews because her team realizes she is unable to answer questions, much like Biden was not able to answer questions, but for different reasons. He is just plain ‚Äúshot,‚Äù and she is just plain ‚ÄúIncompetent.‚Äù Her policies of Open Borders, No Fracking or Drilling for Oil in any Way, Shape or Form, Transgender ‚Äúanything,‚Äù Anti Israel but gross incompetence toward getting anything done for the Palestinians, No Clue on Inflation, or the Economy, Unlimited Money to fight Foreign Wars, and so much more, are CATASTROPHIC. If she is Elected, our County, and indeed the World, will suffer a 1929 Style Great Depression. It will be the Worst in history and AMERICA WILL BE DESTROYED!

Kamala‚Äôs support is collapsing with Black voters. Inflation is hell. Worse, their cities are being used as illegal alien dumping grounds. If Kamala gets 4 more years, the Black Community loses its political power forever because their neighborhoods will all be majority migrant.
President @realDonaldTrump lifted Ron DeSantis, an unknown and unaccomplished Congressman, out of obscurity; catapulted him to the Florida Republican gubernatorial nomination, and had to drag him over the finish line in the skin-tight 2018 election.

ANGELINA: "Illegal immigration hurts black Americans, inflation hurts black Americans, and dangerous cities hurt black Americans."
Legal Scholars are extremely thankful for the Supreme Court‚Äôs Decision today to take up Presidential Immunity. Without Presidential Immunity, a President will not be able to properly function, or make decisions, in the best interest of the United States of America. Presidents will always be concerned, and even paralyzed, by the prospect of wrongful prosecution and retaliation after they leave office. This could actually lead to the extortion and blackmail of a President. The other side would say, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt do something, just the way we want it, we are going to go after you when you leave office, or perhaps even sooner.‚Äù
