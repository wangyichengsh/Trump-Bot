SUBJECT:       Advancing United States Interests When Funding
                             Nongovernmental Organizations
The United States Government has provided significant taxpayer dollars to Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs), many of which are engaged in actions that actively undermine the security, prosperity, and safety of the American people.  It is the policy of my Administration to stop funding NGOs that undermine the national interest. 
I therefore direct the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) to review all funding that agencies provide to NGOs.  The heads of agencies shall align future funding decisions with the interests of the United States and with the goals and priorities of my Administration, as expressed in executive actions; as otherwise determined in the judgment of the heads of agencies; and on the basis of applicable authorizing statutes, regulations, and terms.
