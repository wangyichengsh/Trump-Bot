Trump took executive action to protect American children from irreversible chemical and surgical mutilation.It’s already having its intended effect — preventing children from being maimed and sterilized by adults perpetuating a radical, false claim that they can somehow change a child’s sex. Hospitals around the country are taking action to downsize or eliminate their so-called “gender-affirming care” programs:
President Trump will always protect American children.Promises made, promises kept – again.
