Individuals who are elected\u2014such as the president and vice president\u2014are not officers within the meaning of Section 3. Second, no federal court has convicted Trump of engaging in \u2018insurrection or rebellion.\u2019 In fact, the Senate acquitted Trump of that charge in his second impeachment. Third, some scholars assert Section 3 doesn\u2019t even exist anymore as a constitutional matter after the Amnesty Acts of 1872 and 1898\u2014a matter completely ignored by the court today. Fourth, prior court rulings have held that Section 3 is not self-executing and Congress has never passed any federal law providing for enforcement, meaning that courts such as the Colorado Supreme Court have no legal authority to enforce Section 3.\u201d \n"

Sending merchandise, product, or anything by any other name through another Country, for purposes of unfairly harming America, will not be accepted. In addition, we will make provision for subsidies provided by Countries in order to take Economic advantage of the United States. Likewise, provisions will be made for Nonmonetary Tariffs and Trade Barriers that some Countries charge in order to keep our product out of their domain or, if they do not even let U.S. businesses operate. We are able to accurately determine the cost of these Nonmonetary Trade Barriers. It is fair to all, no other Country can complain and, in some cases, if a Country feels that the United States would be getting too high a Tariff, all they have to do is reduce or terminate their Tariff against us. There are no Tariffs if you manufacture or build your product in the United States.\n"
