An American citizen held hostage in Belarus has been released thanks to the leadership of President Donald J. Trump and his administration — the second American released from captivity abroad in the past 24 hours and the eleventh since President Trump took office.
The remarkable success in freeing American citizens comes as the United States displays a renewed strength under President Trump. In the words of Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Adam Boehler, President Trump “has made bringing Americans home a top priority and people respond to that.”
Promises made, promises kept.
