Melania and I send our warmest greetings to those in the United States and around the world who are celebrating the Lunar New Year. Our Nation is blessed with a passionate and strong Asian-American community that has made countless contributions to our proud history.  For many Americans of Asian heritage, this is a time of rich family traditions.  As people gather together for fireworks and parades, The First Lady and I join them in celebrating and welcoming the Year of the Snake. Traditionally, the snake is associated with wisdom, spirituality, and good fortune.  As we begin America’s golden age, I ask God to bless our Nation with these gifts—may this year bring peace, happiness, and success to all. Happy New Year!
